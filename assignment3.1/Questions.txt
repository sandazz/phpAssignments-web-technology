1. Write a PHP script to extract the file name from the given string
                 Eg: filename = http://localhost/PHPIntro/accessing_strings.php

                       Expected output = accessing_strings.php

2.  Write a PHP script to print duplicate characters from a string

                  Eg: Input: “Java”

                  Output: a   

3. Write a PHP script to find the number of vowels in a given string

4. Write a php function findHighestPopulation($mycountry) to find the highest population state from the given associative array

                $states = array("karnataka" => array ( "population" => "11,35,000", "captial" => "Bangalore"),

                                         "Tamil Nadu" => array( "population" => "17,90,000", "captial" => "Chennai"), 

                                          "Andhra Pradesh" => array("population" => "21,35,000", "captial" => " Hyderabad "), 

                                          “Goa” => array("population" => "8,35,000", "captial" => " Panaji") ));


5. You have two arrays like the following. One contains field labels, the other contains field values. Write a program to output the third array.
$keys = array(

           "field1"=>"first",

            "field2"=>"second",

            "field3"=>"third"

            );

$values = array(

           "field1value"=>"apple",

            "field2value"=>"orange",

            "field3value"=>"graphes"

            );

Output array $keysAndValues :

             Array ( [first] => apple [second] => orange [third] => graphes )
